### Using Extended Reality to Detect the Levels of Attention in Situational Context for ADHD Identification

This project is a VR application that can accurately identify symptoms of ADHD in adolescents using the Oculus Quest 2 headset. The application captures and analyze head-tracking data and gauges user attention during the narration of a story in a stimulus-rich environment for assessing the probability of a positive ADHD diagnosis, and showcase these metrics for statistical evaluation through user-friendly visualizations.
In order to do this, it uses three metrics: User Gaze, Stimulus Response Time and Quiz Responses.
 
This application aims for the following:
-  Reduce the time taken for diagnosis: Using the application, preliminary symptoms of ADHD should be identified within 10 minutes, thereby reducing the time taken in a long (1 hour) formal assessment.
-  Reduce the cost of diagnosis: Due to the removal of the need of a psychiatrist, the estimated cost of evaluation is reduced. This initial assessment will help determine if a formal diagnosis is required, only then will a patient require a medical professional.
-  Make diagnosis accessible: In parts of the world where ADHD diagnosis is inaccessible, this preliminary assessment may be obtained easily, allowing for the easily-obtainable identification of the disorder in a patient.
